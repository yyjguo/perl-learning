#!/usr/bin/perl
#indeed,this is one of the advantages of perl: it already comes with a lot of stuff that you need to make useful and complex programs without doing a lot of work yourself.

# as you develop your code, you may want to consider if you want to use only core modules,so that you can be sure that anyone with perl will have that modules as long as they have at least the same version as you. we will avoid that debate here, mostly because we love CPAN too much to do without it.
